# Using spread operator with Objects in Node JS

In this article, we use node v22.7.0.

For creating an object using the values of a previous object, we can use the spread operator.

"The spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.", cf [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).

## Recreating a new object with all properties of a previous one

We create an object stats with properities. Each property is a number but it could be a string.

```js
const stats = {
  intelligence: 14,
  agility: 12,
  strength: 16,
};
```

If we want to create a new object with similar property, we can use spread operator.

```js
const otherStats = { ...stats };
```

So when

```js
console.log(otherStats);
```

The output will be:

```js
{ intelligence: 14, agility: 12, strength:  }
```

Without spread operator, it is possible to use the most verbose [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign).

```js
const otherStats = Object.assign(stats);
```

## Adding properties to an object

If we want to create a deep copy of stats with a new field, we can use use Object.assign() and then adding the property

```js
const upgradedStats = Object.assign(stats);
upgradedStats.perception = 19;
```

Output will be:

```
 { intelligence: 14, agility: 12, strength: 16, perception: 19 }
```

It is also possible to use [Object.keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) operator:

```js
Object.keys(stats).map((stat) => {
  upgradedStats[stat] = stats[stat];
});

upgradedStats.perception = 19;
```

## Remove fields from an object

```js
const { cleaned, other } = myObject;
```
